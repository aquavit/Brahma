Brahma 0.2 - Release notes
------------------------------------------------------

This 0.2 release is part of the Brahma 2.0 LINQ based approach. This release has the following features

*** Features ***

1. 1D and 2D data-parallel arrays supporting float, Vector2, Vector3 and Vector4 data types.
2. Compiled queries for performance (see note about imperative queries)
3. Support for some BCL functions that map to HLSL functions
4. Support for ternary operators as conditional
5. Support for let statements (these increase performance by adding local variables and computing their value only once)
6. Support for SelectMany, so you can run a query on multiple data-parallel arrays at the same time
... and more

*** Samples ***
I'm afraid there isn't much by way of documentation yet. However, there are two samples

1. A parallel sorting algorithm (odd-even transposition sort)
2. Conway's game of life

Please submit any samples you may cook up, it will help other users.

*** Known Issues ***

Do not use imperative queries. While they might work (sometimes), it is 
a) slow
b) likely to be removed due to problems in the way chunks of expression trees are given to it (so you never know when a query is over) - if you know what I'm talking about and want to help, email me.

*** Dependencies and requirements ***

*** Software ***
1. Managed DirectX needs to be installed on your system
2. The unit tests depend on NUnit but is optional. If you're using NUnit I would recommend TestDriven.NET to run tests from inside Visual Studio.
3. Visual Studio 2008 (Express user may not be able to open the sln: it contains solution folders, sorry!).


*** Hardware ***
1. You need a graphics card that supports Shader Model 3.0
2. The card should support floating point texture formats (A32B32G32R32F in particular)


*** FAQ ***
1. I have a LoaderLock exception: What do I do? 
	Go here (http://www.thezbuffer.com/articles/304.aspx)
2. I get an exception that says "The generated HLSL was invalid, ..."! 
	Do as the exception says, and email that entire error to me along with the query that generated that error.
3. I get some other exception when I run a query
	Send me as much information as you can about the query and the exception thrown. I will try and figure out what's happening
4. I need this method call/member access to be supported!
	Sure. Just let me know what it is you need and I will try to figure out how best to integrate that into Brahma.
5. Brahma rocks/sucks! I have suggestions!
	Send me your comments and I promise to read them. I always welcome constructive feedback and good suggestions.
6. Do you need help?
	Yes, I do. Please let me know what you might be interested in helping with: Samples, documentation, writing an new provider for another API, SlimDX migration, etc. I will deal with this on a case-by-case basis.
